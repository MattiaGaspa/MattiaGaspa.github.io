		<h3>Thinkpad experience</h3>
		<p style="font-size:80%; color:#00FF00;"><em>28/01/2022</em></p></div>
		<p>Some days ago I found an old Thinkpad T41 that my dad found a lot of time ago in a dumpster. The original project was to install gentoo, but I later discovered that it was a single core.</p>
		<p><b>Holy sh*t</b>: it would have taken me a lifetime, without considering that it could have crashed. But let's start from the beginning...</p>
		<h3>Hardware</h3>
		<p>The pc is an old Thinkpad T41. All components are original and the specs are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p><b>Core</b>: an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrino">Intel Centrino</a>, single core at 1.6 GHz clock;<p></li>
			<li><p><b>RAM</b>: 1 Gb (ddr2);</p></li>
			<li><p><b>GPU</b>: an <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/ati-rv250.g26">AMD ati rv250</a>;</p></li>
			<li><p><b>Disk</b>: 71.2 Gb of HDD (connected with PATA).</p></li>
		</ul>
		<h3>OS</h3>
		<p>At first I was undecided between:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><p><b>Debian</b>: but then I discarded it because it uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd">systemd</a> (which is obviously bloated for this system);</p></li>
			<li><p><b>Void</b>: because it uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runit">runit</a>, which is lighter than systemd. But I wanted to go further;</p></li>
			<li><p><b>Alpine</b>: the chosen one, because it use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenRC">OpenRC</a>, my favourite init system, and it uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musl">musl</a>, a lightweight alternative to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glibc">glibc</a> even if it is not as complete as the latter.</p></li>
		</ol>
		<p>During the automatic installation of Alpine Linux, using the <b>setup-alpine</b> command, I had a system crash because, after the root partition format, the system couldn't mount properly mount the partion on <em>/mnt</em>.</p>
		<p>I had to do a <a href="https://docs.alpinelinux.org/user-handbook/0.1a/Installing/manual.html">semi-automatic installation</a> so, after setting the various things, I manually partitioned and formatted the disk, mounted it and <b>BOOM</b> Alpine was installed! (after running <b>setup-disk /mnt</b>)</p>
		<h3>Features</h3>
		<p>The system uses an 100M ext4 boot partition, a 70G jfs root partition and a 1.2G swap partition. I have chosen a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JFS_(file_system)">jfs</a> filesystem for the root partiotion because I have read that use less system resources than zfs or ext4.</p>
		<p>For desktop usage I have tried a lot of window manager, like ratpoison, swaywm, i3wm and icewm, and the best was icewm. Ratpoison often crashed while i3wm and swaywm was slower than icewm, the only cons of icewm is that I have never used it and the default configuration and themes sucks.</p>
		<p>With flatpak installed I have been able to install telegram-desktop but not all applications are available (not and amd64 architecture).</p>
		<h3>Issues</h3>
		<p>The wi-fi doesn't work and installing <em>linux-firmware</em> didn't work. I haven't tested the other peripherals since I haven't used them in my life (what the f*ck does an infrared interface does on a pc???).</p>
		<h3>Final thought</h3>
		<p style="font-size:80%; color:#00FF00;"><em>19/02/2022</em></p></div>
		<p>The laptop is pretty usable for office, LibreOffice works perfectly. Using firefox is not the best idea, but I think that other web browser can work pretty well. IMO this pc can be a nice firewall for the home network (of course not the best).</p>
		<h3>Update</h3>
		<p>After a reinstall, I changed the filesystems</p>
		<ol>
			<li><p><em>/dev/sda1</em> (boot partition): is now a vfat partition;</p></li>
			<li><p><em>/dev/sda3</em> (root partition): is now an <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/XFS_(file_system)">xfs partition</a>, a more performing filesystem.</p></li>
		</ol>
		<p>I also replaced Firefox with <a href="https://www.netsurf-browser.org/">netsurf</a> browser, which is MOOOOOOOOOOOORE lightweight.</p>
		<p>Unfortunately, while I was using the zathura pdf reader, the system crashed and I had to force shutdown throught poweroff button. After that the system gave an <em>Initramfs error</em>...</p>
		<p>I tried to reinstall Alpine Linux but also the live ISO got the same error. Fortunately sometimes the system boot up properly so, when I will have time, I will reinstall the whole thing.</p>
