		<h3>Goodbye Gentoo! See ya later</h3>
		<p style="font-size:80%; color:#1EC9C1;"><em>19/06/2022</em></p></div>
		<p>I have actually decided to move to NixOS from Gentoo. Today I'm in dual boot Gentoo/NixOS because I want to first create my perfect NixOS configuration and becuase I want to make sure to backup everythig on Gentoo.</p>
		<p>You might be asking: why? Even if I still like Gentoo there are some thing that they don't make me take full advantage of its features, in fact Gentoo is rolling distribution but, since I have to compile from source, I update my system like every month and perhaps I exclude heavy, and usually important, packages like firefox and libreoffice.<p>
		<p>An example is that I updated from firefox 96 (maybe, I don't remember) to firefox 100 after twenty days and I'm still using firefox 100 even if my testing NixOS system I have firefox 101.0.1 installed</p>
		<h4>Why should I migrate to NixOS</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><p><b>Nix-pkgs</b>:Nix-pkg is an innovative package manager it makes, basically, your system unbreakable by isolating the packages and, if something wrong happen, you can rollback to previous configurations. You can also use development and build environments thanks to it.</p></li>
			<li><p><b>Updated</b>: NixOS is actually the OS with more packages in it's repos and the OS with more updated packages. This is a consequences of the modules that Nix offers, making the development of the package easier.</p></li>
			<li><p><b>Ausio system</b>: NixOS han pipewire enabled by default.</p></li>
			<li><p><b>Logo</b>: I prefer NixOS logo to the Gentoo one.</p></li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Why should I keep Gentoo</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><p><b>OpenRC</b>: unfortunately NixOS still uses Systemd. I don't hate Systemd because it's bloated, I mean, it's bloated, but the bloat provide more modules and make the writing of modules easier. I prefer OpenRC because I have never studied Systemd.'</p></li>
			<li><p><b>Portage</b>: the portage package manager is older than the nix package manager and therefores it has more features like the USE flags. I always found them fascinating sicne you can customize the package as you want.</p></li>
		</ul>
		<h4>The configuration</h4>
		<p>As you can see in the new dotfile <a hef="https://github.com/MattiaGaspa/dotfiles">repository</a> (the old <a href="https://github.com/MattiaGaspa/dotfiles-gentoo">one</a> got archived), I'm going to use the plasma desktop, the Wayland one, since it has a lot of features and applications (I don't fear compilations time anymore)'</p>
